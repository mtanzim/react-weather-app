# React Weather App

## Requirements

Please create a React app for us that queries the current weather from openweathermap.org and displays the data fetched for the user.
Get started by creating a React app using create-react-app.
We want your app to do the following things:

- Query data from <http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Berlin&APPID=82f13ccba8452fb77eab61ee10ce5d53>
- Display the current weather information for Berlin
- Update every 5 minutes or if the user clicks a refresh button
- Display a table that contains every update fetched
- Keep in mind that the api endpoint can only be queried 60 times a minute (you’ll get a timeout for requests beyond that). This is just an FYI and nothing you’ll have to handle in your code.
- Also, this task is only meant to get an idea of what your code structure and problem solving looks like. We do not care about the design. You don’t have to spend any time on making the app look pretty. We want to get a feel for what you code like only.
